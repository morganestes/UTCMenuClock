This is an obscenely simple program to add the UTC time to the MacOS
Menu Status Bar. I desperately wanted two clocks as the network that I
work on uses UTC Time exclusively for all of our devices. Converting
in my head was a true pain.

The latest version is 1.2afor Mac OS 10.6 and 10.7 (Intel) downloadable from
GitHub in the Downloads section:

Compiled under XCode 4 and MacOS 10.7.

NOTE: After you install this software, you still have to run it to use it.  

Double-click "UTCMenuClock" in your /Applications folder. If you want it to 
start automatically every time, click on the UTC clock in the menu bar and 
select "Open At Login"
